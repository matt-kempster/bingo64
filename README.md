# Bingo64

This repo is a fork of the full decompilation of Super Mario 64
that implements the popular speedrunning challenge known as bingo in
the game itself.

To play the game, optionally enter a seed in the seeds menu during
file selection, then proceed to any file. Press L to view the generated
bingo board, and use the D-pad to get more information about a particular
objective. You win if you complete 5 objectives in a row.

This repo does not include all assets necessary for compiling the ROMs.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the required assets.
The remainder of this README will reflect the decompiled source code's
installation instructions, as they are quite involved.

## Installation

### Windows

Install WSL and a distro of your choice following
[Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
We recommend either Debian or Ubuntu 18.04 Linux distributions under WSL.
Note: WSL1 does not currently support Ubuntu 20.04.

Next, clone the SM64 repo from within the Linux shell:
`git clone https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64.git`

Then continue following the directions in the [Linux](#linux) installation section below.

### Linux

There are 3 steps to set up a working build.

#### Step 1: Install dependencies

The build system has the following package requirements:
 * binutils-mips
 * capstone
 * pkgconf
 * python3 >= 3.6

Dependency installation instructions for common Linux distros are provided below:

##### Debian / Ubuntu
To install build dependencies:
```
sudo apt install -y binutils-mips-linux-gnu build-essential git libcapstone-dev pkgconf python3
```

##### Arch Linux
To install build dependencies:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel capstone python
```
Install the following AUR packages:
* [mips64-elf-binutils](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mips64-elf-binutils) (AUR)


Run `make` to build the ROM (defaults to `VERSION=us`). Make sure your path to the repo
is not too long or else this process will error, as the emulated IDO compiler cannot
handle paths longer than 255 characters.
Examples:
```
make VERSION=jp -j4       # build (J) version instead with 4 jobs
make VERSION=eu COMPARE=0 # build (EU) version but do not compare ROM hashes
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.

The full list of configurable variables are listed below, with the default being the first listed:

* ``VERSION``: ``us``, ``jp``, ``eu``, ``sh``
* ``GRUCODE``: ``f3d_old``, ``f3d_new``, ``f3dex``, ``f3dex2``, ``f3dzex``
* ``COMPARE``: ``1`` (compare ROM hash), ``0`` (do not compare ROM hash)
* ``NON_MATCHING``: Use functionally equivalent C implementations for non-matchings (Currently there aren't any non-matchings, but this will apply to iQue). Also will avoid instances of undefined behavior.
* ``CROSS``: Cross-compiler tool prefix (Example: ``mips64-elf-``).

### macOS

With macOS, you may either use Homebrew or [Docker](#docker-installation).

#### Homebrew

#### Step 1: Install dependencies
Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and the following dependencies:
```
brew update
brew install capstone coreutils make pkg-config tehzz/n64-dev/mips64-elf-binutils
```

#### Step 2: Copy baserom(s) for asset extraction

For each version (jp/us/eu) for which you want to build a ROM, put an existing ROM at
`./baserom.<VERSION>.z64` for asset extraction.

##### Step 3: Build the ROM

Use Homebrew's GNU make because the version included with macOS is too old.

```
gmake VERSION=jp -j4       # build (J) version instead with 4 jobs
```

### Docker Installation

#### Create Docker image

After installing and starting Docker, create the docker image. This only needs to be done once.
```
docker build -t sm64 .
```

#### Build

To build, mount the local filesystem into the Docker container and build the ROM with `docker run sm64 make`.

##### macOS example for (U):
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 sm64 make VERSION=us -j4
```

##### Linux example for (U):
For a Linux host, Docker needs to be instructed which user should own the output files:
```
docker run --rm --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",destination=/sm64 --user $UID:$GID sm64 make VERSION=us -j4
```

Resulting artifacts can be found in the `build` directory.

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to
discuss what you would like to change. Some instructions have been placed in
bingo_guide.txt, if you would like to add a new objective type.

Run `clang-format` on your code to ensure it meets the project's coding standards.
